## Introduction
Our game, Goldilocks’ Adventure, provides a unique twist on the classic folk-lore tale of Goldilocks and The Three Bears. Players have the opportunity to help Goldilocks rectify her mistakes, teaching them the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and making amends. The game offers an enjoyable experience for players of all ages with a meaningful and educational message.

## Navigational Structure
The game is designed with a clear navigation structure that guides players through different scenes, starting from a splash screen, followed by the homepage, a brief story, and two gameplay levels. Visual instructions are provided to help players understand how to play. Once they feel confident, they can begin playing the respective levels. If a player completes level 1 successfully, they can move on to level 2. However, if they struggle, they have the option to retry and continue playing that level or go back to the homepage. Victory in the game is achieved when players successfully finish level 2.

## Audio & Graphic Development Process

### 3.1. Graphics & Images
The graphics & images are mostly drawn using Procreate inside the iPad. Below is detail of the process of creating them.

#### A. Background
##### Level 1
The background was inspired by a youtube video entitled “Pixel Art Background Tutorial - (Aseprite)” by Saultoons but the dimensions used are much larger. Random colours were used initially to get the sense of the background first. Colours are chosen based on the character we’ve already created, Goldilocks

![photo_6084651809030387454_y](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/8ec5354f-1556-419f-a354-135781cd4a03)

Afterwards, the background is rendered to have more sense of depth and dimension in the background.Orange overlay is used on the character for this character to suit the background better.

Lastly, the background was outlined.

##### Level 2
Level 2 was a modification from Level 1 background with an addition of a lane. Below is the rough sketch for Level 2.

![photo_6084651809030387460_y](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/21ddccf3-3f54-4866-83d2-8d633e569b34)

Trees from Level 1 are used for this part.

![photo_6084651809030387461_y](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/a94bc751-e48d-448d-b1a8-2b92c580d66c)

I tried to use the same colour template in Level 1 at first but it does not seem to suit.

![photo_6084651809030387462_y](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/026d7b76-289a-4cae-936a-12e8a5b77614)

The background was outlined just like the background for level 1. Additionally, the background was darkened and saturation was increased.

![photo_6084651809030387463_y](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/1ccb2f91-88e4-4b67-95f0-306760162f32)

Lastly, purple overlay was added over the background and character to get the final result.

#### B. Character
The anatomy of the character was drawn by referring to a tutorial from a youtube video called “ how to draw chibi characters” and the details were added with Goldilocks in mind.

#### C. Ingredients/Tools & Instruction (Level 1)
The tools and Ingredients are traced inside Procreate using the draft sketches provided by Amylia.

![image23](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/05373487-cb00-43b4-9627-eb5e30c39401)
![image14](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/ad159153-ed79-416b-b116-22ce41c6588f)

With these as reference / samples,  the instruction and the assets for ingredients and tools were developed as depicted below.

![image22](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/9b5bd2f8-c6e8-43c9-b482-25949a9fa49d)
![image30](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/6ceabc98-b5f8-4935-8662-249229d0555d)



#### D. Obstacles & Instructions (Level 2)
![image35](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/9be052e2-006f-4b70-9743-5470db3d77c5)


The animals that served as obstacles in level 2 included a monkey, lion, fox, bear, and snake. Notability was the primary tool utilised to create these obstacles. The process involved searching for reference images to gather ideas. Based on these references, the animals were sketched using the pen option in Notability, allowing for a freehand approach. Subsequently, the animals were filled with colours using the highlighter option provided by Notability. Once the drawing and colouring were completed, the image was exported as a PNG file and transferred to Canva to remove the background, leaving only the animal itself. Finally, the background-removed animal image was imported into the library of Animate CC for further use.

![image7](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/a7c19c43-23f5-4a34-8783-b473e4e57ed9)
<img width="922" alt="image24" src="https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/ca664cbb-5b3c-4fac-8dd1-16289933284b">


At the start of the game, an instructional overlay is presented to guide the players. To create this overlay, a hand-drawn sketch, as mentioned before, served as a reference. However, instead of using Notability, Adobe Illustrator was utilised for its versatile design tools. The sketch was recreated using shapes like rectangles and circles, along with text elements. Additionally, the previously sketched animal obstacles were imported into Adobe Illustrator to provide a visual reference for the players.


#### E. Symbols (Hearts, Basket, Credits, Homepage, etc.)

**Hearts**: The hearts are inspired by OpenGameArt.org drawing of a pixel heart, one heart was drawn in Procreate and the other 2 were copied and pasted.

![image19](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/0d4e3e8c-5a88-4351-a624-cb4c00d6c8c3)
![image3](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/6204f1bd-03ce-4488-965f-ef341f48c647)


**Basket**: The basket held by goldilocks to collect the ingredients for porridge as well as to collect the tools was inspired by real life photos of a rattan basket as depicted below.

![image31](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/2152efd7-51e1-4008-bf0a-91b7d03ed6a1)
![image27](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/6cf5c619-efa9-471a-a2f9-6e6155fdabe8)


**The credit scene and homepage were created inside of animate itself.**
The background used in the credit scene is the same as in Level 2 screenplay. Brown overlay was added using Adobe Illustrator over the background to get the subtle look as a final result.

![image15](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/9083f3a7-aacf-4aab-a8cd-3efde9daee82)


Then, in Adobe Animate, the text was added using a “i pixel u” font that we obtained from the Internet. Later on, the font was moved using a motion tween. <br>

The background used in the homepage is the same as in Level 1 screenplay. We added the title, the start and credit button that will lead to the respective pages. 

![image9](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/33fbfb65-e7c8-499c-8328-478f5b672631)


**The game context for both levels were made using Adobe Illustrator. **
The background for the game context Level 1 is the same as Level 1 screenplay. The asset which was created earlier by Alya was then pasted over the background. Then, the dialogue box which is generated using deathgenerator.com is then pasted on the background as well. 

![image33](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/82b59e70-9ee6-4f73-b16c-26e6cfc0dad0)

![image36](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/447c4edb-fdd2-4161-89fd-e52f3e4693b6)


Game context for Level 2 was created using Adobe Illustrator as well. The background was inspired by sequence pictures from Twinkl.

![image2](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/c9769a79-0a54-43dd-a9ed-1395fd7c63dc)


Same like in the game context Level 1, the dialogue box is generated using deathgenerator.com

![image32](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/d7e3c827-05f3-4536-a8ea-86b7c43f0fea)

### 3.2. Audio

#### F. Background Music
ChatGPT were utilised to generate notes for the background music then it was played and recorded in GarageBand using Aurora Over Iceland tool at Slow Crescendo

![image25](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/11ad14fa-0ff2-405b-8515-945cea95a8d9)

![image1](https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/ad02813c-5c8c-4282-95f7-d7c0b775f837)

The video was sped up using Capcut and the video is converted into a .wav file to use inside Animate.

#### G. Level 2
In level 2, the audio elements were produced by utilising online tools for creating sound effects. Three additional audio effects were employed in the following manner:

##### 1. Hit Obstacles Sound Effect
To create the sound effect that plays when the character collides with an obstacle, we used Leshy SFMaker, a retro-style sound effect generator available online. While the website offers a collection of pre-existing sound effects, our requirement was to use original audio effects. Hence, we customised the frequency, depth, wave steps, and length of the presets, resulting in a unique sound effect derived from a preset sample.


##### 2. Win Level Sound Effect
The sound effect triggered upon successfully completing level 1 was generated using an online music sequencer website. We combined two different instruments, a concert harp and a vibraphone, and played the keys in an ascending manner to achieve the desired winning sound effect.

<img width="659" alt="image20" src="https://github.com/alyah0011/Goldilocks-Adventure-Game/assets/121216138/77808f6c-4d21-44bc-9648-6d2feaa7cff5">

##### 3. Lose Level Sound Effect
To create the sound effect for losing the level, we employed an online music box sound generator. Since the winning sound effect was achieved by playing the keys in an ascending manner, the opposite approach was taken this time. The online music box sound generator served as the tool for generating the desired losing sound effect.

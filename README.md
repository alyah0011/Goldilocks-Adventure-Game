## Introduction
Our game, Goldilocks’ Adventure, provides a unique twist on the classic folk-lore tale of Goldilocks and The Three Bears. Players have the opportunity to help Goldilocks rectify her mistakes, teaching them the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and making amends. The game offers an enjoyable experience for players of all ages with a meaningful and educational message.

## Navigational Structure
The game is designed with a clear navigation structure that guides players through different scenes, starting from a splash screen, followed by the homepage, a brief story, and two gameplay levels. Visual instructions are provided to help players understand how to play. Once they feel confident, they can begin playing the respective levels. If a player completes level 1 successfully, they can move on to level 2. However, if they struggle, they have the option to retry and continue playing that level or go back to the homepage. Victory in the game is achieved when players successfully finish level 2.

## Audio & Graphic Development Process

### 3.1. Graphics & Images
The graphics & images are mostly drawn using Procreate inside the iPad. Below is detail of the process of creating them.

#### A. Background
##### Level 1
The background was inspired by a youtube video entitled “Pixel Art Background Tutorial - (Aseprite)” by Saultoons but the dimensions used are much larger. Random colours were used initially to get the sense of the background first. Colours are chosen based on the character we’ve already created, Goldilocks

Afterwards, the background is rendered to have more sense of depth and dimension in the background.Orange overlay is used on the character for this character to suit the background better.

Lastly, the background was outlined.

##### Level 2
Level 2 was a modification from Level 1 background with an addition of a lane. Below is the rough sketch for Level 2.

Trees from Level 1 are used for this part.

I tried to use the same colour template in Level 1 at first but it does not seem to suit.

The background was outlined just like the background for level 1. Additionally, the background was darkened and saturation was increased.

Lastly, purple overlay was added over the background and character to get the final result.

#### B. Character
The anatomy of the character was drawn by referring to a tutorial from a youtube video called “ how to draw chibi characters” and the details were added with Goldilocks in mind.
